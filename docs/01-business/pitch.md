# PollRoom - The Business Case

*Written from the perspective of Sarah Chen, Corporate Trainer*

## The Problem I Face Every Day

Hey, I'm Sarah Chen, and I've been doing corporate training for about 8 years now. You know what really drives me crazy? Trying to get honest feedback from a room full of people.

When I ask "How many of you feel confident about this new process?" and everyone just raises their hands, I know half of them are lying. They're looking around, seeing other hands go up, and they don't want to be the only one who looks lost. Plus, in a room of 50 people, I can't actually count all those hands anyway.

And don't get me started on remote participants - they're basically invisible during these moments. I need something that lets people vote honestly without everyone else seeing their answer, and I need to see the results right away so we can actually talk about what's really going on.

## The Solution: PollRoom

So here's what I'm thinking - a dead simple polling app that's basically like sli.do but way more focused. No bells and whistles, just the stuff that actually matters.

### How it would work in my real training sessions

1. **Before my workshop**: I create a room and get a code like "TRAIN789"
2. **When people arrive**: I put the code up on the screen and everyone types it in
3. **During the session**: I ask something like "Rate your confidence with this new process from 1-5"
4. **Everyone votes**: They tap their answer on their phone, completely private
5. **Results pop up**: I see a nice chart showing 60% are at level 2, 30% at level 4, etc.
6. **Real conversation happens**: Now I know exactly who needs help and can adjust my approach

## Who Would Actually Use This?

### Corporate Trainers (like me)
We're constantly trying to figure out if people are actually getting what we're teaching. Instead of asking "Any questions?" and getting crickets, we could see that 70% of people are confused about step 3. Game changer.

### Event Organizers
You know those awkward moments at conferences where the speaker asks "How many of you use this tool?" and like 3 people raise their hands? This would actually show the real numbers and make discussions way more interesting.

### Small Business Teams
When you're trying to decide between two options and everyone's too polite to speak up, anonymous voting gets you the real opinions. No more "I'm fine with whatever" responses.

## The Competitive Landscape

### sli.do
They're the big name in this space, but honestly? It's overcomplicated. You need a PhD to figure out all their features, and it's expensive for what most people actually need.

### Mentimeter
Pretty good, but it's built around presentations. What if I just want to poll people without having to integrate with PowerPoint?

### Kahoot
Great for making learning fun, but it's too "gamey" for professional settings. I don't want my corporate training to look like a quiz show.

**My angle**: Keep it stupid simple. Just polling, nothing else. No bells, no whistles, no confusion.

## How to Make Money

### Freemium Model (because everyone loves free stuff)
- **Free**: 3 polls per session, up to 20 people - good enough for small teams
- **Pro ($9/month)**: Unlimited polls, up to 100 people, maybe throw in some custom colors
- **Enterprise ($29/month)**: No limits, fancy analytics, and API access for the big companies

## Success Metrics

### Are people actually using it?
- How many polls do they create per session?
- Do people actually vote or just ignore it?
- Do they come back for more sessions?

### Is it making money?
- Monthly recurring revenue (the holy grail)
- How much does it cost to get a new customer?
- Are people sticking around or leaving after a month?
- Would they recommend it to a friend?

## What Could Go Wrong

- **Internet issues**: If the WiFi is garbage, the whole thing falls apart
- **Getting people to try it**: Everyone's already using 47 different tools, why would they add another one?
- **Big competitors**: sli.do has way more money and resources than I do
- **Technical headaches**: Making everything update in real-time is actually pretty hard

## The One-Sentence Pitch

"Instant, anonymous polling that actually works - no signup, no confusion, just type a code and vote."
