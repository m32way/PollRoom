# PollRoom - Performance-First Architecture

## üöÄ **IMPORTANT: Serverless-First Approach**

**UPDATE**: After architecture review, we're pivoting to a **serverless-first approach** for MVP. This provides the fastest path to market at $0 cost.

**For Serverless MVP** (Recommended): See [serverless-mvp.md](./serverless-mvp.md)
**For Performance-First** (Future Scale): This document describes the high-performance architecture for 1000+ concurrent users

## üéØ **Overview**

This guide provides detailed, junior-developer-friendly instructions for implementing PollRoom using a performance-first architecture. Each step includes specific tasks, validation checkpoints, and troubleshooting guidance without providing exact code (so you'll still need to consult documentation and think through implementation).

**Note**: The serverless approach in [Serverless-MVP-Architecture.md](./Serverless-MVP-Architecture.md) is recommended for MVP validation due to $0 cost and faster time to market.
