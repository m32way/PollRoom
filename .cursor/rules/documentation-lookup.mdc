# Documentation Lookup Rule

**CRITICAL**: Always use Context7 MCP tools for documentation lookup before implementing features.

## Process:
1. Use `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` to find the correct library ID first
2. Then use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` to get up-to-date documentation
3. This ensures accurate implementation based on current best practices and API specifications
4. Never rely on outdated knowledge when implementing features

## Examples:
- Before implementing Jest configuration, use Context7 to get current Jest docs
- Before using Supabase features, check Context7 for latest Supabase documentation
- Before implementing Next.js features, verify current Next.js patterns via Context7

This rule ensures we always have the most current and accurate documentation for any library or framework we're working with.
