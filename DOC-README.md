# 🗳️ PollRoom - Real-time Anonymous Polling Platform

## ⚡ **TL;DR**
**Serverless real-time polling** for instant audience feedback. **3-day MVP implementation** at **$0 cost**. Mobile-first anonymous voting with 6-character room codes.

**Tech Stack**: Next.js + Supabase + Vercel → **[Start Building](./docs/02-architecture/serverless-mvp.md)** 🚀

## 🎯 **What is PollRoom?**

PollRoom solves the **"immediate audience feedback"** problem for presenters, trainers, and educators. Instead of complex polling tools requiring accounts and setup, PollRoom provides:

- **🔗 6-character room codes** → Instant audience joining
- **📱 Mobile-first anonymous voting** → No apps or accounts needed  
- **⚡ Real-time results** → Live feedback as votes come in
- **💰 $0 operational cost** → Serverless architecture for MVP validation

### **Quick User Journey**
1. **Presenter**: Creates room → Gets code "ABC123"
2. **Audience**: Visits pollroom.app → Enters "ABC123" 
3. **Everyone**: Votes anonymously → Sees live results update

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **🚀 MVP Architecture (Recommended)**
**Goal**: Fastest validation at $0 cost
- **Frontend**: Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Vercel Functions (serverless)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL + Real-time  
- **Sessions**: Vercel KV (Redis)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (auto-scaling)

**Performance**: 50-100 concurrent voters, <500ms vote latency
**Cost**: $0/month during validation phase
**Timeline**: 3 days to production

👉 **[Complete Architecture Guide](./docs/02-architecture/serverless-mvp.md)**

### **⚡ Performance Architecture (Future Scale)**
**Goal**: Handle 1000+ concurrent users with <100ms latency
- **Backend**: Fastify + Native WebSocket + Raw SQL
- **Caching**: Redis + In-Memory hybrid strategy
- **Protocol**: Binary WebSocket messaging

**Performance**: 1000+ concurrent voters, <100ms vote latency  
**Cost**: $50-200/month operational
**Timeline**: 12 days implementation

👉 **[Performance Architecture Guide](./docs/02-architecture/performance-first.md)**

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **For Developers (MVP Implementation)**
```bash
# 1. Read the architecture (5 min)
docs/02-architecture/serverless-mvp.md

# 2. Follow implementation guide (3 days)  
docs/02-architecture/serverless-implementation.md

# 3. Check development rules (essential)
docs/03-implementation/development-rules.md
```

### **For Business Stakeholders**
```bash
# 1. Understand the market opportunity
docs/01-business/pitch.md
